# python_hello_world

Hello World project created as an introduction to the Python programming language. This project utilizes string variables and the print function to display two messages on the terminal.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Check your local machine for a version of Python, in your terminal run the command: 
```
python --version
```
 If this returns an error try to run:
 ```
 python3 --version.
```

2. If neither of those commands returns with a Python version number, download Python using the link under the Prerequisites section.

3. Download the ZIP file from Github or clone the repository to your local machine.

4. Run the .py file using the terminal with the command:
```
 python hello_world.py
``` 
or if your machine has an earlier version of Python installed as well as Python 3+ run: 
```
python3 --version
```
